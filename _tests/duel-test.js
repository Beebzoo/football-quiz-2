/* THE CORNER DUEL.
 *
 *     node _tests/duel-test.js
 *
 * The shot used to be two questions in a row and is now one question and a
 * guess, and a guess is the one thing in this app that cannot be checked by
 * playing it once. So most of this file is arithmetic: the same duel run a
 * couple of thousand times, counted, and compared against the number the
 * design claims. If a save comes out at a half when it is supposed to be a
 * quarter, nobody at a table would ever notice, and every match in the app
 * would be wrong.
 *
 * FOUR THINGS ARE UNDER TEST AND ONLY THE FIRST IS OBVIOUS.
 *
 *   THE RULE. Same corner is a save, any other corner is a goal, and that is
 *   checked over all sixteen pairs rather than sampled, because sixteen is
 *   small enough to do properly.
 *
 *   THE SECRET. The keeper must not be able to learn the striker's corner
 *   before he commits to his own. That is checked three ways: the screen he is
 *   looking at, the state that goes out to every other phone in the room, and
 *   the computer, which is the one keeper that could cheat without anybody
 *   being able to see it happen. Two thousand rolls against a corner the
 *   striker never varies: a keeper who peeked would save all of them.
 *
 *   THE NUMBERS. A quarter for anybody, a half for a Keeper, an eighth at a
 *   penalty and with a centre-half in goal. Those three are the whole of what
 *   the keeper trait and the old Extreme tiers were translated into, so they
 *   are asserted as numbers and not as behaviour.
 *
 *   THE BANK. A duel is not a question and must never be filed as one. The
 *   row it writes is checked against _tools/retier.js's own filter, which is
 *   the thing that would otherwise re-tier real questions out of the bank on
 *   the strength of somebody guessing bottom left.
