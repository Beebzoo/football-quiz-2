/* THE TOSS IS THE SCREEN EVERY MATCH OPENS ON.
 *
 *     node _tests/toss-test.js
 *
 * It used to be two flags and a coin, so there was nothing in it that could be
 * wrong. Staging it puts three men and two names on it, and names are facts:
 * the moment the screen says "Cannavaro" it is claiming that Cannavaro is one
 * of the eleven about to play, and it is claiming it 562 times over 22 pools
 * that nobody is going to open one by one.
 *
 * The harvest marks the SQUAD captain, off the tournament's squad table, and
 * the eleven is the side that actually started that country's last match.
 * Those two disagree for eighty-seven sides, where the man with the armband
 * was rested or came on later, and a man on the bench cannot stand at the
 * centre circle. So the first section here is the only one that matters much:
 * whoever the screen puts on the circle has to be on the pitch afterwards.
 *
 * The rest guards the two things a staging like this classically breaks. It
 * must not decide anything, because the coin already knows which way up it is
 * landing before it starts spinning, and everything drawn round it is a
 * consequence rather than an input. And it must not leak into the sixteen-bit
 * skin or out of it, which _tests/pixel-test.js polices in general and this
 * checks for the referee in particular, because he is the one figure variant
 * that exists only on this screen and nothing else would notice him going.
