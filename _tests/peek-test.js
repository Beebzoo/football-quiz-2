/* Nobody reads the answer off their own phone before the steal.

     node _tests/peek-test.js

   Three phones in one room. The point of a steal is that the table does not
   know the answer yet, and the multiplayer build was painting it onto every
   phone the moment the player on the hook revealed it. By the time the STEAL
   IT button appeared, everybody had already read it.

   So this walks a real question through a three-phone room and checks the
   answer text against what each phone is actually showing, at every stage:
   the reveal, the steal offer, the stolen attempt, and the end.

   Reuses the stub DOM and the fake realtime bus from mp-test.js. */
