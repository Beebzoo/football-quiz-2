/* THE SAVE SURVIVES THE SHELF.
 *
 *     node _tests/migrate-test.js
 *
 * There is no server. The only copy of anybody's album is the ball2-mine key
 * in one browser on one phone, and the only backup is a string somebody may
 * have pasted into a note. So the day the album stopped being one book and
 * became a shelf of them, and every sticker id grew a book on the front, was
 * the day a bad migration could silently delete two years of somebody's
 * evenings. This file is the reason that is allowed to ship.
 *
 * Four claims, and all four are load-bearing:
 *
 *   NOTHING IS LOST. Stickers, their counts, the finished pages, the list of
 *   countries you have already played as, and Your XI. Especially Your XI:
 *   mine().dream.men is eleven sticker ids stored a thousand lines from the
 *   album with nothing about it saying so, and the old reader cut at the last
 *   slash, so a book on the front of the id turns a saved eleven into eleven
 *   nobodies with no error anywhere.
 *
 *   RUNNING IT TWICE CHANGES NOTHING. A migration is a thing that happens on
 *   every load until somebody deletes it, so "once" is not a property it can
 *   have. It has to be a no-op the second time and the hundredth.
 *
 *   A HALF-DONE ONE FINISHES RATHER THAN DOUBLES. Every step guards on the old
 *   field rather than on a version number, which is what lets it be run again
 *   on its own half-finished output without inventing a sticker.
 *
 *   AND A SAVE IT DOES NOT RECOGNISE IS LEFT ALONE. A phone that has already
 *   run a newer build has a save this build cannot read. It refuses: it does
 *   not migrate it, does not repair it, and above all does not write over it,
 *   so going back to the newer build finds everything still there.
