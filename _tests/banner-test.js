/* THE BANNER: the art parses, the whole cycle draws, and the loop dies.
 *
 *     node _tests/banner-test.js
 *
 * Four things can go wrong here and not one of them shows up on a screenshot.
 *
 * A SCREENSHOT ONLY TESTS THE INSTANT IT LANDS ON. This is the spec's own
 * hardest-won rule and it is the reason for the sweep below: while it was being
 * drawn, a function went missing in a bulk edit and the page threw on every
 * frame after the chip. Three separate screenshots all happened to land before
 * it and all looked perfect. So this steps the entire cycle at four hundred
 * points through the real drawing code and counts the throws, rather than
 * sampling it and hoping.
 *
 * A HARD-CODED ARRAY LENGTH OUTLIVES THE ART. The same spec had a [0,1,2,3]
 * survive the move from four poses to eight, which left frames four to seven
 * undefined and killed the animation on the first frame that reached for one.
 * So the pose count is asserted to be derived from the art and not written down
 * twice.
 *
 * A TYPO IN A GRID IS A MISSING PIXEL NOBODY NOTICES. One letter per pixel over
 * eight leg poses and a body is a lot of characters, and a row that is 31 long
 * draws a notch in a boot you will look past for six weeks.
 *
 * AND THE CANVAS IS NOT CALLED "stage". The spec's own markup calls it that,
 * because on a page of its own that is the obvious name. In here #stage is the
 * one element every screen in the app is rendered into, so the two would have
 * fought over the single most load-bearing id in the file. That is asserted
 * here so nobody re-introduces it by pasting the spec in again.

   THERE IS NO SCROLLING IN HERE, so the honest way to test this is to hand the
   sandbox its own IntersectionObserver, let bnStart wire itself to it exactly
   as it does in a browser, and then be the browser: call the callback back with
   isIntersecting true and false and count the frames that get booked. That
   tests the wiring rather than a door cut into the side of it, which is why the
   closure hands out running() and nothing else.

   THE FAILURE THIS IS FOR IS INVISIBLE. Two chains painting the same canvas
   animate at exactly the right speed and cost twice the battery, so no
   screenshot and no pair of eyes can catch it. Frames booked can.

   AND THE FRAME HANDLE IS ZERO ON PURPOSE. Zero is a legal requestAnimationFrame
   handle and zero is falsy, so any guard that reads the handle as a yes or no
   falls over here. The old bnStart did exactly that. Running the whole sequence
   against a zero handle is what proves the replacement does not. */
