/* THE CUP.
 *
 *     node _tests/cup-test.js
 *
 * A run is seven matches spread over days, which makes it the only thing in
 * the app where a bug costs somebody a week rather than a minute. So the rules
 * that get checked here are the ones where a mistake is silent:
 *
 *   A RUN ADVANCES ONLY ON A RESULT. Starting a match must not move it and
 *   abandoning one halfway must leave it exactly where it was, or a closed tab
 *   quietly knocks you out of the World Cup.
 *
 *   THE GROUP IS THE REAL GROUP. The other three have already played each
 *   other with the real scores, so finishing second is a bar somebody actually
 *   had to clear rather than a number the app invented.
 *
 *   THE TABLE SETTLES ON GOAL DIFFERENCE, THEN GOALS SCORED, which is how 2006
 *   settled it, and it is the difference between going through and going home.
 *
 *   THE BRACKET SLOT IS THE DRAW. Winning the group has to put you somewhere
 *   different from finishing second, or winning it means nothing.
 *
 *   LOSING A KNOCKOUT ENDS THE RUN AND KEEPS THE RECORD. Out is out, and the
 *   seven matches you played are still yours to look at.
