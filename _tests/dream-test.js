/* YOUR XI.
 *
 *     node _tests/dream-test.js
 *
 * SQUADS-PLAN.md §2.6, and the rule that makes it a game rather than Ultimate
 * Team is the only rule worth testing hard:
 *
 *   YOU CAN ONLY FIELD MEN YOU HAVE COLLECTED. If a man who is not in the
 *   album can reach the eleven by any route, the album stops meaning anything
 *   and so does every pack.
 *
 *   ONE KEEPER, EXACTLY. Slot 0 of every shape is the goalkeeper and the
 *   restart, the save and the shootout all say so, so a side with two or none
 *   is a side that breaks on the first kick-off.
 *
 *   AND IT HAS TO BE A SIDE LIKE ANY OTHER. Everything downstream reads a
 *   squad: the shapes, the ladder, the traits, the report. If Your XI is not
 *   shaped like a country it fails somewhere nobody is looking.
