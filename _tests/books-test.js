/* THE SHELF.
 *
 *     node _tests/books-test.js
 *
 * ALBUM-PLAN sections 1 and 7: one book per tournament instead of one album
 * welded to the 2006 World Cup, and the state that carries it. album-test is
 * still about the rules of collecting; this one is about there being fifteen
 * of them.
 *
 * Four claims:
 *
 *   EVERY BOOK IS FINISHABLE. An id has to be unique inside its book and it
 *   has to lead back to exactly one man, in all sixteen pools and not just in
 *   the one somebody happened to open. A book where two men share a slot is a
 *   book nobody can close, and it says nothing on the screen about why.
 *
 *   EURO 2020 IS THE ONE THAT PROVED IT. Three of its squads carry two men in
 *   the same shirt, because a late replacement walked into the number of the
 *   man he came in for. Under slug and number alone, three of those six men
 *   have no slot at all.
 *
 *   EVERY BOOK KEEPS ITS OWN PROGRESS. Switching shelf moves where the packs
 *   come from and nothing else. What is in a book you walk away from is still
 *   in it when you come back.
 *
 *   AND THE DAILY DOES NOT FOLLOW YOU. The calendar is nailed to the 2006
 *   book by name, because the man of the day is the one thing on this phone
 *   that is the same on everybody else's, and a daily that moved with whichever
 *   book you were collecting would make the six squares meaningless.
