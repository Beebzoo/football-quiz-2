/* THE COMPUTER, ON A CLOCK.
 *
 *     node _tests/tempo-test.js
 *
 * ai-test proves the opponent finishes a match and that its dice are the
 * published dice. ai-beat-test proves every band lands inside its own floor and
 * ceiling and that the tempo dial moves all of them together. This one is about
 * the things that sit between the beats: the hold after the camera swings, the
 * two halves of the toss, the side he would rather be playing as, the card's
 * entrance, and how long the whole match takes end to end. That last one is a
 * different sort of claim and it needs a different sort of harness: a clock the
 * test owns.
 *
 * WHY A VIRTUAL CLOCK RATHER THAN REAL SECONDS. A solo match is meant to take
 * eight to twelve minutes. No test suite is allowed to take eight minutes, and
 * a test that runs the beats at a hundredth of their length is not measuring
 * the beats. So setTimeout and clearTimeout are swapped for a queue the test
 * drives by hand: the app schedules exactly what it schedules, in milliseconds
 * it believes in, and the test jumps the clock from one booking to the next. A
 * whole match then plays out in about a second of real time with every beat,
 * every hold and every celebration at full length.
 *
 * It works because mp-test loads the app with vm.runInContext and the app never
 * keeps a reference to setTimeout: it looks the name up on the global every time
 * it calls one. Reassigning them on the sandbox after the load is therefore
 * enough, and nothing in the app can tell.
 *
 * WHAT IS ASSERTABLE AND WHAT IS A MODEL. The computer's half is numbers in
 * index.html, so it is measured exactly and printed, and the print is the
 * point: a band typed with a digit wrong shows up in the output the next time
 * anybody runs this. The human's half is not in the app at all, so it is a
 * MODEL, written down below under HUMAN, and the eight-to-twelve-minute claim
 * is a claim about that model and nothing else. Change the model if a real
 * person disagrees with it; do not change it to make a number go green.
