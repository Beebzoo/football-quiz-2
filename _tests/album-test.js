/* THE ALBUM.
 *
 *     node _tests/album-test.js
 *
 * Not cards in the abstract: the 2006 World Cup sticker album, 736 men who are
 * already in the deck, drawn rather than fetched. It needs no new data and no
 * new images, which means the only things that can go wrong are the rules.
 *
 * Three of them matter and all three are here:
 *
 *   A STICKER IS A SLUG AND A SHIRT NUMBER. Not a name, because names change
 *   spelling between harvests, and not an index, because indexes move. Every
 *   id has to be unique and every one has to resolve to a man.
 *
 *   A PACK IS THREE, and it can never hand out something that is not in the
 *   album, because an album with a sticker in it that has no slot is an album
 *   nobody can finish.
 *
 *   AND FINISHING A PAGE HAS TO PAY. The bench in The Dugout is the reward,
 *   which means an unfinished page is a real cost: eleven men and nobody to
 *   bring on.

/* THE PAGE GRID, SLICED OUT OF THE SCREEN, because a country page can now carry
   a card that is not in it. Picking a sticker up lifts it into a full-screen
   overlay written after the sheet, and that overlay holds a second real drawing
   of the front face, so a count of class="alst" across the whole stage stopped
   being an invariant and became a number that depends on whether somebody is
   holding a card.

   The count is worth keeping, because it is what catches a child class that
   merely begins with those four letters, and a failure there would read as a bug
   in the album rather than as a bug in a class name. So it is scoped instead of
   dropped: every slot in the book lives between .alsheet and .alsheet-f, that is

  /* ================= AND THEY ARE HANDED OVER ONE AT A TIME =================
     The pack screen was three cards arriving at once, and everything below is
     about the sequence that now goes over the top of it. The overlay is
     appended to document.body, which this harness deliberately keeps no list
     of, so none of it can be read out of the stage. That is not a hole in the
     test, it is the thing being tested: the stage holds the finished screen and
     only the finished screen, from the first frame to the last, and the reveal
     is read where it actually lives, off PACK_REVEAL.

     AND IT IS DRIVEN RATHER THAN SAMPLED. A reveal that is only checked at its
     end has not been checked at all, because the end of this one is a screen
     that was painted before it started, so every assertion about it would pass
     against a sequence that never ran. So the clock below is stepped card by
     card and each card's whole panel is compared against what the builder says
     that card should look like, which is the only way to catch a sequence that
     shows the right three men in the wrong order or shows one of them twice.

     THE COIN IS PINNED FOR THE TWO RUNS THAT ARE COMPARED WITH EACH OTHER.
     albumPackDraw walks its own array and hands back the first man with weight
     left on him, so with Math.random at nought a packet is exactly the first
     three drawable men of the first side in the book, every run, on every
