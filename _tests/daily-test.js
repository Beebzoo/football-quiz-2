/* THE DAILY BALL.
 *
 *     node _tests/daily-test.js
 *
 * Six questions up the ladder, the same six for everybody on the same day.
 * That last clause is the whole feature: the share line is only worth pasting
 * if the person reading it had the same six, so "the same six" is the thing
 * this suite is really about.
 *
 * Two ways it could quietly stop being true, and both are checked:
 *
 *   A REBUILD THAT REORDERS THE BANK. S.used fell into this once already:
 *   it holds indexes, so appending a pack sends every parked match to a
 *   different question. A daily that picked by index would do worse, because
 *   it would change questions people have already played and screenshotted.
 *   It picks by a hash of the words instead, and the test proves it by
 *   shuffling the bank and asking again.
 *
 *   A QUESTION SPENT TWICE. The daily and the Friday night draw from the same
 *   deck and must not burn each other's questions.
