   is what localStorage is for, but three things could still take it away: a
   guest phone that never filed its own matches, a half-written value, and a
   bug writing an empty list over a full one.

   Every check here boots a SECOND instance against the same storage, which is
   what closing the app and starting it again actually looks like.
