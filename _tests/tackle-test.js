/* The tackle, driven rule by rule.
 *
 *     node _tests/tackle-test.js
 *
 * The tackle is the first rule in this mode that gives the DEFENDER something
 * to do, and almost all of it is invisible in the code: whether a card went to
 * the right man, whether a red actually takes him out of the shape, whether a
 * foul in the box becomes a penalty.
 *
 * Since the marks became a POSSESSION decision rather than a per-pass one,
 * most of what can go wrong is bookkeeping across passes: a mark that fires
 * twice, relief handed out every ball instead of once, the phone asking to
 * cross the table mid-possession, or last possession's men still ticked. Those
 * are what the middle of this file is about.
 *
 * It opens with h2NearestTo, because everything here stands on it: a card that
 * says "the left wing-back brought him down" is worth nothing if the app cannot
 * tell the left wing-back from the right one.
