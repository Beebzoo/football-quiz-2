/* HOW LONG THE COMPUTER TAKES, and whether the beat it armed is still the one
 * the screen is waiting for.
 *
 *     node _tests/ai-beat-test.js
 *
 * Two things are being defended here and they are not the same thing.
 *
 *   THE BANDS ARE THE PERSONALITY. A single 620ms pause before every decision
 *   is what made the opponent read as a machine, so the beats are now a table
 *   of bands and the table is only worth anything if every draw actually lands
 *   in its band, if AI_TEMPO moves all of them together, and if AI_BEAT still
 *   collapses the lot for a test that has four hundred questions to get
 *   through and no patience.
 *
 *   THE ARMED BEAT CAN GO STALE. There is one timer for the whole driver, and
 *   a beat armed for one screen used to run anyway when the screen had moved
 *   on: tap a country off the grid while he is picking his own and his beat
 *   lands afterwards and takes the side you wanted. The re-check lives in
 *   aiLater now, so the test for it is one shape repeated: arm the beat, move
 *   the game under it, and prove nothing happened. The case list is checked
 *   against the number of aiLater calls in the driver, so adding a call site
 *   without adding a case fails here rather than in somebody's match.
