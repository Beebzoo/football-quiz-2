/* CALIBRATION.
 *
 *     node _tests/retier-test.js
 *
 * Tiers are hand-assigned, so somewhere in the bank there is an Extreme
 * everybody gets and an Easy nobody does. _tools/retier.js finds them from
 * what people actually answered, and this suite is about the one thing that
 * could go wrong quietly while it does:
 *
 *   A RE-TIER MUST NOT MOVE ANY OTHER QUESTION. S.used holds indexes and a
 *   parked match holds a used list, so splicing a question out of a tier
 *   re-points every index above it: a match somebody left half-played comes
 *   back showing a different question, and a daily somebody screenshotted is
 *   no longer the daily they played. So the tool marks in place and appends,
 *   and this checks that every index in every tier is exactly where it was.
 *
 *   AND THE APP HAS TO HONOUR THE MARK. A retired question is still sitting in
 *   its old tier, so if the draw does not skip it, the re-tier has done
 *   nothing except put the question in the deck twice.
 *
 * The fixture is generated from the deck on disk rather than checked in, so it
 * cannot drift out of date the first time somebody re-tiers for real.
