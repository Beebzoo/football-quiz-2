/* THE THREE OF US, HANGING ON THE YOUR CLUB BANNER.
 *
 * Heads over the bar, four fingers on its top edge, and the one you tap comes
 * up far enough to show his shirt and his flag. What makes this worth a file is
 * not the toggling, which is three lines, but the four ways it can be quietly
 * wrong, and three of those are invisible without a browser.
 *
 * THE SKIN EATING THE FACES. body.pixel .fig > * sets background-image:none
 * !important on every part and every pseudo of every figure, and the skin is
 * always on. That rule has already silently eaten one thing in this app's
 * history: the mown bands under #pitchbg stopped drawing the day the skin went
 * permanent and nobody noticed for months. These three are the only men in here
 * with faces, so the declarations that beat it are asserted, and so is the rule
 * they beat, because a guard that stops guarding should say so.
 *
 * HOW MUCH OF A MAN SHOWS. "Heads only" and "not more than mid body" are the
 * whole brief and they are geometry, so they are checked as geometry: the
 * figure is 22 units tall with the head at rows 0 to 4, the flag on the chest
 * at 6 to 7.5 and the shorts from 13. A number that drifts past 13 is a man
 * standing up, and nothing on a screenshot would tell you which side of the
 * line you were on.
 *
 * THE PAGE JUMPING. The room above the bar is paid for once so that a man
 * standing up does not shove the banner and everything under it down the page.
 * That is one declaration and losing it would be a regression nobody would
 * describe as a bug, only as "it feels jumpy".
 *
 * AND THE COUNT LEAVING THE APP'S OWN RANGE. setupCount is offered on the setup
 * page as exactly two pills. A strip that can set it to one produces a state no
 * pill can light and nothing else in the app can reach.
