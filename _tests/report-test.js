/* THE SCOUTING REPORT HAS TO BE TRUE.
 *
 *     node _tests/report-test.js
 *
 * A report is the one thing in the app that makes a claim about the match
 * rather than showing you the match. A scoreline cannot be wrong; "your worst
 * ball was to van Persie" can be, and it would be believed, because nobody
 * counts their own passes.
 *
 * So this plays a match with known outcomes and checks the report says exactly
 * what happened. It also checks the two traps the log fell into by design:
 * a substitute must not inherit the balls the man he replaced lost, and one
 * match must not read another match's rows.
