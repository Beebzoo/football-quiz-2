/* The clubs you can play AS in a league's football game.
 *
 *     node _tools/build-clubs.js [league...] [--dry] [--force]
 *
 * One file per league: assets/<dir>/clubs.json, shaped exactly like the 2006
 * World Cup deck build-wc2006.js writes, so h2Squad cannot tell them apart.
 *
 * WHY IT IS HARVESTED AND NOT TYPED. Six leagues is a hundred and twelve clubs
 * and well over twelve hundred players in the elevens alone, and this repo has
 * learned more than once that a name typed from memory is a name that is
 * quietly wrong. Everything here comes off Wikipedia, where every club article
 * carries its first team in one machine-readable template per man:
 *
 *   {{Fs player|no=1|pos=GK|nat=GER|name=[[Marc-Andre ter Stegen]]}}
 *
 * WHICH CLUBS. Getting the list of clubs right turned out to be the hard part,
 * and three plausible sources all lied in different ways:
 *
 *   - Wikidata P118 returns every club that was EVER in the league, because
 *     the property sits on the club and editors do not always close the old
 *     statement. Filtering to statements with no end date helps and is still
 *     not the current table. It also matches players and seasons, so an
 *     unfiltered query came back with two and a half thousand rows, most of
 *     them footballers.
 *   - The season article's standings template is authoritative when it is
 *     there, and the Bundesliga keeps its table in a SEPARATE transcluded
 *     template, so the article itself parses to zero teams.
 *   - That separate template, fetched directly, came back missing two clubs
 *     the same article's own location map listed.
 *
 * So nothing here trusts one source. Candidates are pooled from all of them,
 * and then every candidate has to EARN its place by having a first-team squad
 * on its own article. That check is not extra work, it is the work: the squad
 * has to be fetched anyway, and a candidate that is not a club (the Premier
 * League map labels the city of London exactly the way it labels Aston Villa)
 * simply has no squad and falls out. The count is then reported against what
 * the league is supposed to have, and a mismatch refuses to write.
 *
 * WHICH ELEVEN. A squad list is not a team sheet, so there is no starting XI
 * in the data to read. Players are picked by SHIRT NUMBER within each
 * position, lowest first, which is deterministic and checkable and is the same
 * rule build-wc2006.js uses. It is not a claim about who started on Saturday.
 * Shape is 1 GK, 4 DF, 3 MF, 3 FW, which is what the pitch wants.
 *
 * THE BENCH is kept too, twelve more by the same rule, because a substitution
 * that says "Sneijder replaces Landzaat" needs a Sneijder to name.
