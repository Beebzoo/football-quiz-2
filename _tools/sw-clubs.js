/* Keep the service worker's precache list in step with what you can play.
 *
 *     node _tools/sw-clubs.js              generate, guard, bump the cache
 *     node _tools/sw-clubs.js --dry        say what would change, write nothing
 *     node _tools/sw-clubs.js --no-flags   leave the pool badges out
 *     node _tools/sw-clubs.js --shrink     yes, I did mean to drop some
 *
 * Every team picker in the app draws a badge per side, and a badge that is not
 * precached is a grey box on a phone with no signal, which is most of where
 * this gets played. A pool whose own file is not precached is worse: the menu
 * row opens onto nothing. Both change whenever a club goes up or down or a
 * tournament is added, so they are GENERATED between two markers in sw.js
 * rather than maintained by hand. Run this after every build-clubs.js run and
 * after adding a pool.
 *
 * WHAT IT NOW COVERS, and why the DIRS list is gone. This file used to hold six
 * folder names, typed here, which made the tool that exists so nobody has to
 * remember sw.js by hand into a thing to remember. It now reads the app's OWN
 * POOLS registry out of index.html, the way _tests/assets-test.js does, and
 * CUP_YEARS beside it. So:
 *
 *   CLUB_DECKS   a league pool's clubs.json, and the index.json and mc.json
 *                beside it, because a league with precached clubs and no
 *                questions is a picker that opens onto nothing.
 *   CLUB_CRESTS  every crest those clubs.json files name.
 *   POOL_FILES   every squad pool's file, plus a cup file per CUP_YEARS.
 *   POOL_FLAGS   the badges those squad pools name, and only those. Not the
 *                whole of assets/natflags, which is a different decision.
 *
 * Measured when this was written: 9 of the app's 22 pools were in the install
 * and 13 were not, because six club pools came in through CLUB_DECKS and
 * wc2006, wc2022 and finals were typed into EXTRA_ASSETS by hand. The other
 * thirteen were a menu row that did nothing offline, and nothing anywhere said
 * so. A pool added to index.html is now in the install on the next run of this
 * with nothing typed here, which is the whole point of the file.
 *
 * THE BADGES ARE OPT-OUT RATHER THAN OPT-IN, and the number is why. Every badge
 * the squad pools actually name came to 83 files and 79KB when this was written
 * and the run prints both every time, against an install already past sixteen
 * megabytes. A pool whose file is cached and whose picker then draws a screen of
 * grey boxes offline is half a job. --no-flags is there if you disagree. This is
 * NOT the whole of assets/natflags, which is 156 files nothing has asked for.
 *
 * FOUR GUARDS, and each of them is something this repo has actually been bitten
 * by rather than a precaution.
 *
 *   1. EVERY PATH IS ON DISK. Cache.addAll is all or nothing: one 404 and the
 *      whole install rejects, the app runs with no cache at all, and nothing on
 *      screen says a word. Nothing is written until every generated path opens.
 *   2. EVERY LIST IS SPREAD. sw.js already carries two lists, NATFLAGS and
 *      MANAGER_LOGOS, that are declared and never used by anything, and each of
 *      them looks exactly like a working precache until you go and count. A
 *      generated list that nothing reads is worse, because it looks maintained.
 *      So the file is read back, with this tool's own block cut out first, and a
 *      list only counts as used if something outside the block spreads it.
 *   3. NOTHING SHRINKS BY ACCIDENT. If the registry regex stops matching, the
 *      honest failure is a short list, a bumped cache and an install with less
 *      in it than yesterday that looks like a clean build. A list that comes
 *      back smaller than the one already in sw.js stops the run. A club really
 *      did go down, or a pool really was retired, is what --shrink is for.
 *   4. THE CACHE IS BUMPED, because a precache list that changed and a cache
 *      name that did not is the single most confusing thing that can happen in
 *      this repo: the code is right, the tests are green, and the phone keeps
 *      showing you yesterday.
 *
 * IT IS NOT THE ONLY WRITER of sw.js. _tools/_questions/eredivisie/build-ere.js
 * writes ERECRESTS between its own pair of markers in the same file, and
 * _tools/build-stickers.py writes STICKERS between a third pair. This only ever
 * touches the span between its own two markers and the CACHE line, so the three
 * cannot fight. Do not widen that.
 *
 * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. The generated block sits ABOVE EXTRA_ASSETS and far
 * above ASSETS, because const is not hoisted and a list declared below the array
 * that spreads it throws a ReferenceError on install. That happened here from
 * v111 to v123 and nothing visibly broke, the app just quietly stopped working
 * offline. Anything added to the block goes in the block.
