/* WHAT EACH MAN ACTUALLY DID IN GERMANY.
 *
 * RUN IT AFTER THE ELEVENS. The pipeline is squads, then the real elevens,
 * then this, then the careers: build-elevens.js rewrites every position to
 * the one the man actually played, and the traits below read positions.
 *
 *     node _tools/build-tournament.js            dry run, read the table
 *     node _tools/build-tournament.js --write    stamp it onto the deck
 *     node _tools/build-tournament.js --who "Klose"
 *
 * The Dugout wants traits, and a trait has to come from somewhere. Typing one
 * out of memory is how a quiz ends up telling a room that somebody was a
 * finisher when he did not score all summer, so every trait in this app is
 * EARNED off the tournament itself: goals, cards, appearances and the armband,
 * read out of the nine match articles Wikipedia keeps for 2006.
 *
 * Nine fetches. Eight group pages and the knockout stage, about 390KB, and the
 * same API call build-man-leagues.js already uses, cached the same way.
 *
 * TWO TRAPS, both found by counting and both worth spelling out, because they
 * do not look like bugs, they look like results.
 *
 *   {{goal|17||48|pen.}} is minute-then-note PAIRS. Split it naively and
 *   "pen." counts as a goal, which on its own turned David Villa's three into
 *   five. Count numeric tokens only.
 *
 *   {{goal|4|o.g.}} is an own goal, and it is listed under the OPPOSING side's
 *   block, because that is where the goal counted. Credit it naively and you
 *   make finishers out of defenders: Gamarra, Sancho, Zaccardo and Petit, who
 *   are precisely 2006's four own goals.
 *
 * The eligibility it produces is deliberately NOT the trait. The harvest says
 * what a man COULD be; the budget in the app says how many are switched on. A
 * side with six eligible finishers still only gets three points to spend, so
 * Brazil having more good players does not become Brazil having more traits.

     brackets after the name and 2022 gives it a field of its own, and every one
     of these articles carries exactly one per side, so a side that comes back
     without a captain is a pattern that cannot read that article rather than a
     side that walked out without one. Three Euros were coming back short,
     euro2004 fifteen of sixteen, euro2016 thirteen of twenty-four, euro2024
     eighteen of twenty-four, and reading the rows that went missing turned up
     two more spellings and one accident.

       name={{sortname|Hugo|Lloris}} instead of name=[[Hugo Lloris]]. Every Euro
       from 2004 on mixes the two freely inside a single group, and a pattern
       that insists on the wikilink throws away whoever happens to be written
       the other way round. That alone cost euro2016 eleven of its sides.

       other=[[List of Scotland national football team captains|captain]]. The
       link still says captain, it just does not point at the same article, and
       the old pattern tested where the link went rather than what it said.

       And the old pattern only ever reached "other=" when no closing brace
       stood between it and the name, which was never a rule about captains, it
       was an accident of writing [^\n}] to keep the match on one line. Half the
       squad rows carry an {{age}} template in between, and that brace shut them
       all out.

     So the two halves are independent now: the name is a wikilink or a
     sortname, the armband is any wikilink whose VISIBLE text is c or captain,
     and anything at all may sit between them so long as it stays on the one
     line the template occupies.

     READING WHAT THE LINK SAYS RATHER THAN WHERE IT GOES IS LOAD-BEARING, and
     it is the half that would otherwise have quietly broken a pool that already
     worked. 2018 Argentina writes Mascherano as other=[[Captain (association
     football)|vice-captain]], the same target as Messi, and the de-dupe below is
     per MAN rather than per side, so a pattern matching on the target hands
     Argentina two captains. It only looks safe in the old code because the brace
     rule was accidentally shutting that row out. Belgium the same year is why
     the C is taken in either case: theirs reads |Captain]] with a capital.

     Measured across all fifteen tournament pools this is one captain on every
     one of the 408 sides, and it takes nobody’s armband away. */
