 *     node _tools/build-wc2006-xi.js              dry run, read the elevens
 *     node _tools/build-wc2006-xi.js --write      stamp them onto the deck
 *     node _tools/build-wc2006-xi.js --who Italy
 *
 * There is no starting eleven in a squad list, so build-wc2006.js picked one
 * by shirt number within position and said so in its own comment. That is a
 * reasonable eleven and it is not anybody's eleven. It puts Robben on the
 * Dutch bench and Landzaat in the side, and it has Zaccardo at right-back for
 * the Italy that won the thing. Anyone who watched the tournament sees it in
 * ten seconds, which makes it exactly the sort of quietly-wrong data this repo
 * exists to avoid.
 *
 * THE RULE: the eleven who started that team's LAST match at the tournament.
 * The final for the two who got there, the exit for everyone else. It is the
 * eleven people remember, it is one table per match on Wikipedia in the same
 * template every tournament has used for decades, and it comes with the real
 * positions and a real shape.
 *
 * POSITIONS COME FROM THE LINE-UP, NOT THE SQUAD LIST. A man listed as a
 * midfielder who started at right-back started at right-back. That is the
 * whole point of reading the match report rather than the squad.
 *
 * AND THEN THE HARD PART. The shapes index the eleven in a fixed order: slot 0
 * is the keeper, 1 and 2 the centre-backs, 3 and 4 the wide defenders, 5 the
 * holding midfielder, 6 and 7 the two in front of him, 8 to 10 the front line.
 * A real line-up is not in that order and sometimes does not fit it at all: a
 * back three has no wide defenders and a 4-4-2 has no ten. So the mapping is
 * done here, once, by preference, and every team where it had to make a
 * judgement is PRINTED rather than silently accepted. A wrong mapping is a
 * keeper on the wing, which is the bug the position sort was written to stop.
