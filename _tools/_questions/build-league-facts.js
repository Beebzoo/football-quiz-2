/* League questions harvested from the season articles, not written from memory.
 *
 *     node _tools/_questions/build-league-facts.js <league> [--from=1995] [--write]
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The first hundred league questions here were written out of
 * my own head and checked afterwards, and two things went wrong with that.
 * Twelve of them turned out to be rewordings of questions the Classic bank
 * already ships, because the Classic bank already carries 837 Premier League
 * rows and 706 La Liga ones. And the further down a league you write, which is
 * exactly where a league deck earns its place, the less reliable anybody's
 * recall is. A half-remembered second-placed side is not a small error in this
 * app: on the pitch a wrong question decides a pass.
 *
 * So the backbone is harvested. Every season article carries its final table as
 * a machine-readable template:
 *
 *   |win_LEI=23|draw_LEI=12|loss_LEI=3|gf_LEI=68|ga_LEI=36
 *   |status_LEI=C   |status_AST=R
 *   |name_LEI=[[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]
 *
 * Points are computed, the table is sorted, and the questions fall out of it:
 * champions, runners-up, third, who went down, the best attack, the meanest
 * defence. The top scorers table beside it gives the golden boot and his club.
 *
 * These are CORRECT BY CONSTRUCTION rather than corroborated after the fact,
 * which is a different and much stronger thing than what check-league.js does.
 * They are written straight out as checked-*.json with verdict ok, and the
 * `src` on every row is the article the numbers were read from.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO is the BALL tier. A story is not in a table,
 * and "which club finished third in 2009-10" is not a BALL question however
 * obscure it is. Those stay hand-written, which is affordable because there are
 * far fewer of them.
