/* Corroborate a league's raw questions against the sources they cite.
 *
 *     node _tools/_questions/check-league.js <league> [--write] [--verbose]
 *
 * Turns raw-*.json into checked-*.json by going and looking. For every row it
 * fetches the article the row names in `src` and asks whether the answer, and
 * the distinctive words of the question, are actually in it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT. It is CORROBORATION, not proof. An article that
 * contains both "Leicester City" and "2015-16" does not prove Leicester won
 * that season, and this tool does not pretend otherwise. What it reliably
 * catches is the failure that matters most here: an answer that is simply not
 * in the source at all, which is what a half-remembered name looks like. That
 * is the difference between a bank that is occasionally arguable and one that
 * is confidently wrong, and on the pitch a confidently wrong question does not
 * merely annoy somebody, it decides a pass.
 *
 * Anything it cannot confirm comes back as `review`, never `drop`. A machine
 * that has not found a name has not proved a negative, and build-league.js
 * ships only ok and fixed, so an unconfirmed row simply does not go out until
 * a human has looked at it.
 *
 * THE CACHE. Sources repeat heavily across a deck, so every article is written
 * to _cache/ on first fetch and read from there afterwards. Re-running after an
 * edit costs nothing and does not hammer Wikipedia for the tenth copy of the
 * same season article. Delete _cache/ to force a refresh.

   Every one of them came from being unsure of the fact and hedging rather than
